# Railway Reservation System
### A project by [Group-12](#team)

Welcome to the Railway Reservation System project! This application is designed to manage railway bookings, allowing users to search for trains, book tickets, and manage reservations with ease. Developed using Java and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, our system is designed to be fast, secure, fool-proof and effective.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
You may click the following link to view our [Progress Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Z7jFryslJz_vN9HPYvExjK6KguzUKElF3G71ouHhjc4/edit?usp=sharing).

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following tools installed:
- `Java v15.0.2`
- `Your preferred IDE` (e.g., Eclipse, VS Code, etc.)

### Installation

1. Clone the repo ([URL to the Repository](https://github.com/MohaCodez/RailwayReservationSystem-2.0.git)):<br>
`git clone https://github.com/MohaCodez/RailwayReservationSystem-2.0.git`

2. To access and run the .java files, head over to the `java-files` folder and run the main class:<br>
```cd java-files```<br>
```javac Main.java``` //Does this line throw an error? [Troubleshoot](#troubleshooting)<br>
```java Main```

### Troubleshooting

1. In case of version mismatch errors while compiling, you must first delete all `.class` files. So run the commands:<br>
```cd java-files```<br>
```rm *.class```<br>
And then continue to [Installation](#installation)

2. In case of any other errors, you can reset the software by running the commands:<br>
!Keep in mind, all user data will be lost!<br>
```cd java-files```<br>
```rm *.ser```<br>
And then continue to [Installation](#installation)

## Usage

After installation, you can run the application by executing the main class in the backend folder. For detailed usage, refer to the documentation.
